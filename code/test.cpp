/*Prep:
Remove Aces, Jack, Queens, and Kings of Hearts & Diamonds for a 44-card deck
Start with 20 health points
Draw 4 cards to start first room

Gameplay:

Creating Rooms: The first Room is created by drawing four cards.
Completing Rooms: You complete a room by resolving three cards.
You can fight a Monster, equip a Weapon, or heal with a Potion.
After completing a Room, draw three more cards to make the next Room.
Skipping Rooms: At the start of a new room, you can choose to run away. 
Shuffle the four cards into the bottom of the deck; you can't skip twice in a row.


Card Mechanics
Monsters (Spades and Clubs): Deal damage to player equal to their value.
Weapons (Diamonds): Equip them to reduce damage equal to their value, but they can "break" with use.
Health Potions (Hearts): Recover health points equal to their value, can only be used once per room.

EQUIPPING WEAPONS
1-3: Rusty Dagger
 You stumbled upon a small, lifeless creature. Embedded in its torso, is a dagger.
 With a slight tug of the hilt, the dagger slides out. The blade is rusted and stained with blood.
 But a blade nonethess. "You equipped the (1-3) of Diamonds."

4-6: Old Sword
You find, slumped against the wall, the skeleton of a long-dead adventurer. 
 His armor now a leather coffin, laid to rest with sword still in hand.
 You take the blade. Its edge dull, yet enough heft to cleave a limb or two.
 "You equipped the (4-6) of Diamonds."
7-9: Royal Sword
 
10: Lost Knight's Sword
 You could barely call it a sword. The weapon is colossal- 
nearly your height, chipped and blackened by time.

Yet even dulled, its iron hums with weight and finality.

HEALING POTIONS
1-3: Minor healing
4-6: Moderate healing
7-9: Major healing
10: Altar/Fountain of Healing

Heal Messages (4 unique messages)
Minor Heal (1-3 Heal): 
"You drink the healing potion, and a mild warmth spreads through your body.
 The aches and pains dull, but it's not enough to fully restore your strength."

Moderate Heal (4-6 Heal):
"The healing potion goes down smooth, and you feel a surge of energy.
 Your wounds start to close, and your body regains some of its strength."

Major Heal (7-9 Heal): 
"You drink the potion, and a rush of warmth floods your system. 
 Your body feels revitalized, your wounds nearly gone. 
 You're back on your feet, stronger than before."

Altar of Healing (10 Heal): 
"You kneel before the altar, and a golden light envelops you.
 Your wounds vanish completely, and you feel an overwhelming sense
 of peace and vitality course through your body."

üçµ 1‚Äì3: Minor Heal ‚Äî "Tincture of Herbs"
A faint trail of dried blood leads to a collapsed figure slumped against the wall.
Beside them lies a leather satchel, torn open, its contents spilled across the floor.
Among broken vials and shattered glass, one small bottle remains intact‚Äî
a tincture of herbs, bitter on the tongue but potent enough to dull the pain.

You drink it. Warmth spreads through your limbs. The worst of your wounds begin to knit.

üß™ 4‚Äì6: Moderate Heal ‚Äî "Bandaged Cache"
You stumble upon a makeshift camp tucked behind a fallen pillar.
The fire‚Äôs long gone cold, but a canvas pack rests beneath a stone altar,
filled with dusty bandages, dried poultices, and a sealed waterskin.

You patch yourself up, the scent of herbs and ash lingering in the air.
It's not elegant, but it‚Äôll hold. You feel steadier.

üïØÔ∏è 7‚Äì9: Major Heal ‚Äî "Sanctuary Shrine"
A narrow corridor opens into a small sanctuary‚Äîwalls carved with sigils of peace and healing.
Melted candlewax pools beneath cracked sconces, and a statue of a forgotten goddess watches silently.
At her feet, offerings lie untouched: healing salves, linen wrappings, and a basin of clean water.

You kneel, and tend to your wounds. The room hums with stillness,
as if the air itself wills your body to mend.

‚õ™ 10: Altar of Healing ‚Äî "The Font Eternal"
You descend into a vaulted chamber, the stonework untouched by time.
Braziers flicker with pale blue flame, casting long shadows over intricate murals‚Äî
scenes of warriors blessed, restored, reborn.

At the center stands a marble font filled with shimmering water.
As your hands cup the liquid, it glows faintly‚Äîcool and luminous.

You drink deeply. Light floods your body. Every wound closes.
For a moment, it feels as if death itself would hesitate.

/* How to implement weapon durability mechanic?
- 1. When equipped, a weapon's durability isn't set.

- 2. When attacking with a weapon for the first time,
- its durability becomes equal to the target monster's attack value.

- 3. Once set, you can only attack monsters with an attack value lower
- than your weapon's current durability score.

- 4. Subsequent attacks will set your weapon's durability score equal
- to the target monster's attack value.alignas

- When you attack a monster with a weapon for the first time, it will gain a durability
- score equal to the monster's attack value. After this, you can only target monsters
- with an attack lower than the current durability. Future attacks will set durability score
- to the target monster's attack lower until: either "breaking" at durability 2 or until you
- equip a new weapon.

PSEUDOCODE:
if (monster.getAtk() >= weapon.getDurability) 
{ cout << "[1] EQUIP WEAPON (Take " << full << " damage)\n"}
else { cout << "[1] EQUIP WEAPON (Take " << reduced << " damage)\n"}

  * SCOUNDREL: A Solo Card-Based Dungeon Crawl
  * 
  * Goal:
  * Scoundrel is a single-player game where you explore a dungeon created by
  * a deck of cards. Each room is formed by drawing cards from the deck, which
  * could be a monster, weapon, or potion card. You must battle monsters, equip
  * weapons, and manage your health to surive. Your goal is to complete all the 
  * rooms (depleting all cards from the deck) and survive the dungeon!
  * ----------------------------------------------
  * 
  * Setup:
  * - Use a standard 52-card deck (red face cards and Aces are removed).
  * - You start with 20 health points.
  * - The deck forms the dungeon. Each room is made up of 4 cards dealt face up.
  * - Select 3 cards to play to complete the room. The last card is kept for the next room.
  * - You choose to skip a room. The game will put all 4 cards back in the deck and deal a new hand.
  * - You can skip as many times as you want, but cannot skip twice in a row.
  * 
  * ----------------------------------------------
  * Card Values:
  * - Number cards are valued at their face value (e.g., 2‚ô£ = 2, 3‚ô† = 3).  
  * - Face cards: Jack = 11, Queen = 12, King = 13, Ace = 14.
  * 
  * Monsters
  * - Clubs and Spades are monsters that deal damage equal to their value (2-14).
  * - When a monster appears in a room, you'll see its value, and must choose how to fight it.
  * 
  * Weapons
  * - Diamonds are weapons.
  * - Only equip one weapon at a time. When a new weapon is equipped, it replaces the old one.
  * - A weapon can only attack a monster weaker than the last monster it defeated.
  * - If you equip a weapon, you can use it to reduce damage from a monster's attack.
  * 
  * Health Potions
  * - Hearts are health potions.
  * - You consume **one** potion per room to heal.
  *     - This first potion restores health based on its value (e.g., 2‚ô• = +2 health).
  *     - Additional potions consumed in the same room will have no effect.
  * 
  * ----------------------------------------------
  * Combat
  * - When you select a monster to fight in a room, you enter combat.
  * - You'll automatically defeat the monster, but you will take damage.
  * - For example, if you face the Jack of Clubs (11 damage), you must choose how to fight:
  *     - No weapon? Fight barehanded and take full damage = monster's damage.
  *     - With a weapon, subtract the weapon's attack from the monster's damage.
  * 
  * - After defeating a monster, your weapon's durability will decrease.
  * - It can no longer fight monsters with an attack equal or greater to the last monster fought the weapon.
  * 
  * ----------------------------------------------
  * Winning:
  * - Complete all rooms in the dungeon to win.
  * - If your health drops to 0, the dungeon defeats you. Try again!
